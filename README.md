# Tradie-Trackeer

<b>Efficient Work Scheduling App.</b><br>
This project is from group project from Dev Academy, and I am remaking from the scratch to consolidate the concepts and make clear code. The idea was to make a scheduling app using all the tools including front & backend skills we've learnt throughout the bootcamp, and I took a front-end lead for api calls and hooks.

### Goal

Use backend and frontend routes to save and filter data.
